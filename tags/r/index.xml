      <description>Project Scope In this data, we have daily readings of minimum temperatures from Melbourne, Australia for 10 years (1981-1990). I was curious to see if any global warming trends would be visible on the 10-year scale. The reason for choosing minimum temperatures might not seem obvious, but I decided to play with those in order to observe extreme case of global warming. If minimum temperatures directly indicate presence of global warming, then we may need to do something before it is too late.</description>

      <description>Project Scope In our study, we are interested in finding out which parameters contribute to the patient blindness and which do not. We used three methods to identify those parameters:
 Kaplan-Meier Curve (univariate analysis) Log-rank test (univariate analysis) Cox Proportional-hazards model (uni- and multivariate analysis)  Key Exploratory Findings   It was discovered that whether or not a patient received treatment was significant. Those who received treatment were 57% less likely to lose vision as those who did not receive treatment Those patients who were in the high risk category were 106% more likely to lose vision as those who are in the medium group.</description>

      <description>App Link
  Goal RShiny app displays top 5 personality traits such as extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness necessary for a successful data scientist / data analyst across various professions and employment sectors as well as demographics data and undergraduate background
Sample group Sample was taken from 140+ Business Analytics and Information Management graduates from Purdue University. Sample cannot generalize population statistic
Sample Picture of the Extraversion  From the picture above, it is possible to notice that data scientists in the food industry along with other professionals in the construction business have the highest average scores of 30.</description>
