      <title>Time Series Analysis of Minimum Temperatures in Melbourne, Australia</title>

      <description>Project Scope In this data, we have daily readings of minimum temperatures from Melbourne, Australia for 10 years (1981-1990). I was curious to see if any global warming trends would be visible on the 10-year scale. The reason for choosing minimum temperatures might not seem obvious, but I decided to play with those in order to observe extreme case of global warming. If minimum temperatures directly indicate presence of global warming, then we may need to do something before it is too late.</description>

      <description>Project Motivation As someone who absolutely loves life, I wanted to explore what were some of the main driving mechanisms behind suicide and what can be done with the data
Project Source WHO Suicide Statistics
Key Findings  Even though some of the highest suicide numbers reported are in Russia, United States, and Japan, the suicide % rate per capita is the highest for Lithuania, Hungary, and Russia as can be seen in the following figure:   The study would have been more comprehensive if data from China and India were included.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Predicting Project Payment Latency in the Covid-19 Era</title>
      <link>https://eerga.github.io/post/o2c/</link>

      <description>Abstract This study develops an order-to-cash process map predictive solution to better understand home remodeling projects&#39; pre- and post-COVID-19 payment latency. In remodeling projects, the day a project is sold (and past rescission) to the time payment is received or installment is first accepted is defined as “order-to-cash.” The risks of delayed processes and delay customer payments can hurt the company’s solvency and financial stability. Especially in the economic condition caused by the pandemic.</description>

      <title>Survival Analysis of Patients with Diabetic Retinopathy</title>

      <guid>https://eerga.github.io/post/survival/</guid>
      <description>Project Scope In our study, we are interested in finding out which parameters contribute to the patient blindness and which do not. We used three methods to identify those parameters:
 Kaplan-Meier Curve (univariate analysis) Log-rank test (univariate analysis) Cox Proportional-hazards model (uni- and multivariate analysis)  Key Exploratory Findings   It was discovered that whether or not a patient received treatment was significant. Those who received treatment were 57% less likely to lose vision as those who did not receive treatment Those patients who were in the high risk category were 106% more likely to lose vision as those who are in the medium group.</description>

      <title>Twitter &amp; Plane Landing Correlation Assessment</title>
      <link>https://eerga.github.io/post/twitter/</link>

      <guid>https://eerga.github.io/post/twitter/</guid>
      <description>Project Scope Google Cloud Platform (GCP) has real-time Twitter and flights datasets available. We decided to explore the possibility of correlation between the number of successfully landed commercial flights and overall Twitter activity. Assuming this hypothesis is proven, our team would have recommended Twitter to make a joint program with airlines using the hashtag #landedsafelywith[name_of_the_airline_company] to promote flights for specific airlines. As a result, this would create a mutually beneficial relationship between Twitter and the associated airline companies.</description>

      <description>Project Scope Our Data Analytics team utilized GCP and Data Studio to conduct exploratory analysis (EDA) along with utilizing machine learning algorithms to identify areas of improvement for the Yellow Cab company and come up with suggestions that would increase its market share.
ML Models The two main machine learning models used were Boosted Classifier Tree and Linear Regression
One of the key exploratory findings  Not only is it possible to see that the highest activity of NYC Yellow Cab is in the Manhattan neighborhood but also that credit cards was the most utilized payment option.</description>

      <description>Project Overview Firm collapse prediction has been a subject of interests for almost a century and it still ranks high among hottest topics in economics. The aim of predicting financial distress is to develop a predictive model that combines various econometric measures and allows to foresee a financial condition of a firm. The purpose of the bankruptcy prediction is to assess the financial condition of a company and its future perspectives within the context of long-term operation on the market.</description>

      <title>The Popularity Secret Behind Pokémon Card Resale Market</title>
      <link>https://eerga.github.io/post/pokemon/</link>

      <guid>https://eerga.github.io/post/pokemon/</guid>
      <description>Goal Our Data Analytics team assessed the influence of Pokémon YouTubers on Pokémon card resale. Our hypothesis was: the higher the YouYube views are, the higher the resale rate of Pokémon cards is. We web scraped historical data of Pokémon card prices and top 10 Pokémon YouTubers’ views, using Wayback Machine and Python 
What we used The packages we used are Chromedrive and BeautifulSoup.
Project Conclusion After conducting statistical analysis and building a descriptive model, we concluded that YouTube views solely cannot explain an increased popularity in Pokémon card resale and other features should be incorporated into the study.</description>
